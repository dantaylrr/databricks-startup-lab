# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our datasets are now properly ingested, secured, with a high quality and easily discoverable within our organization.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's explore how Databricks SQL support your Data Analyst team with interactive BI and start analyzing our customer Churn.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To start with Databricks SQL, open the SQL view on the top left menu.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You'll be able to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create a SQL Warehouse to run your queries
# MAGIC - Use DBSQL to build your own dashboards
# MAGIC - Plug any BI tools (Tableau/PowerBI/..) to run your analysis

# MAGIC ## Step 1: Creating SQL Queries 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our users can now start running SQL queries using the SQL editor and add new visualizations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The data engineering team has asked you as a data analyst for some key insights that will need to shared with different stakeholers in the organizations, we are looking for the following insights:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Churned vs unchurned customers by the operating system they are using (platform)
# MAGIC - Total churned customers by Gender
# MAGIC - Average Monthly recurring revenue
# MAGIC - Total amount of customers who have churned 
# MAGIC - Stretch: Monthly recurring revenue over time
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks SQL queries use a special type of compute called [SQL compute](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/index.html) which is optimized for running highly concurrent BI queries. Feel free to check out [this doc](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/index.html#create-a-sql-warehouse) for steps to create one if you don't already have one. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Tip 1**:
# MAGIC You can use the AI Assistant to get some help in generating those queries. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Tip 2**:
# MAGIC You can use the [SQL language reference doc](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/index.html) if you need some help
# MAGIC  wrting those queries yourself.

# MAGIC ## Step 2: Let's start Dashboarding!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" width="600px" src="https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/retail/lakehouse-churn/lakehouse-retail-c360-dashboard-churn-prediction.png?raw=true" />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The next step is now to assemble our queries and their visualization in a comprehensive SQL dashboard that our business will be able to track. This step is divided into four sub steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 2.1** Create a report that displays 4 different visualizations from the datasets that were created in the previous step using SQL queries. You can use the same SQL Query code from the last step here as well. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 2.2** Publish the dashboard and make it viewable by others in the organization. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 2.3** Ensure that this Dashboard refreshes on a bi-weekly basis.

# MAGIC ## Step 3: Going beyond Dashboards with Genie
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img style="float: left; margin-top: 10px" width="600px" src="https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/retail/lakehouse-churn/lakehouse-retail-churn-ai-bi.png?raw=true">
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Dashboards are a great way for us to analyze and get insights of our data to answer specifc reccuring questions about the business, but what if we need more? What is our users have questions beyond what a dashboard can offer us? Instead of continuing to add one-off visualizations to a report which may or may not be helpful to others, we could instead use Genie to ask natural language questions and enable other users to do the same. This is what we will do in this step.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Some stakeholders within the organization have asked for some additional insights to the Dashboard you've built for them, here is when we'll create a genie space that will allow them to ask any adhoc questions they have of their data and enable a more self-analytics solutions for them. The Genie room will need to be able to answer the following questions: 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.1**: Create a new Genie room, this is what we'll use to ask questions of our data, you can follow the steps in [this doc](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/set-up.html#create-a-new-genie-space).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.2** When creating any genie space we have to set it up with the datasets that we need to ask the data of. As a best practice we need to ensure that all datasets are well documented. To do so, we'll head over to the Catalog explorer, select the datasets and ensure the table and columns have comment descriptions, see here for [steps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/comments/ai-comments.html#add-ai-generated-comments). Once we have this, we can now start asking questions of our Genie space.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.3** Start by generating responses to the following queries:
# MAGIC - How many customers have churned over time? (compare that to the answer of the SQL query in the previous step)
# MAGIC - What is the average monthly payment by platform?(visualize this)
# MAGIC - What is the total Revenue in 2023?
# MAGIC - What is the churn rate for each country represented in the user base? (visualize this)
# MAGIC - What was the daily revenue from June 1 to June 9 2023? (visualize this)
# MAGIC - What is the churn distribution by Gender?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For each questions you ask, make sure to view the underlying SQL that is generated. You will notice in some questions Genie might not get the answer right because of some missing context, here it is up to us to provide it the right business rules that it needs to use to answer questions correctly. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here it is up to us to fill in any gaps in knowledge by using [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/set-up.html#general-instructions) or Sample SQL Queries. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.4** For each question we need to ensure the following:
# MAGIC - When calculating churn rates we need to ensure we eliminate null values.
# MAGIC - When asked about a fiscal quarter, we need Genie to know that we are in Q4 and that the Fiscal year starts in Feb and that we are currently in 2023
# MAGIC - When asked about the top countries with churned users, ensure answers are sorted descendingly. 
# MAGIC - When asked about categorical values for Gender, replace 1 with female and 0 with male.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Add each of those as an instruction then answer the following questions. 
# MAGIC - What is the total sales amount in Q2?
# MAGIC - What is the distribution of churn between males and females?
# MAGIC - what are the top countries with user churn?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.5** Ask Genie the following question:
# MAGIC - What are the top regions with churned users?
# MAGIC You'll notice Genie's response as: there are no regions in the table schema. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In order to change that we need to add a sample SQL query that categorises countries into 2 regions: AMER and EMEA, add that Sample SQL query and try asking the question again. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step 3.6** We need to ensure everyone who accesses the genie space is able to run similar queries on regions using that same query logic. Use trusted assets to turn that same query into a verified answer for users. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### **Hints:** 
# MAGIC - Trusted assets in Genie are predefined functions and example queries meant to provide verified answers to questions that you anticipate from users. When a user submits a question that invokes a trusted asset, itâ€™s indicated in the response, adding an extra layer of assurance to the accuracy of the results. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Trusted assets use table value functions and only accept a table as a result. Look at examples in [this link](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/trusted-assets.html#define-a-trusted-asset) on how to convert your query into a trusted asset. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Stretch task: **Step 3.7** Create [Benchmarks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/benchmarks.html) to log frequently answered questions along with expected answers and then run the benchmarks and assess the accuracy of each question
